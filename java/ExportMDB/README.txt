This code is an early start on an export to RDF module that
can automatically find all tables in a database, the internal
relations and then export the database as one RDF file.

Intended use is to convert MS-Access databases.

To use it with MS-Access download the trial version of the HXTT driver from
http://www.hxtt.com/access.zip or http://www.hxtt.com/access.html
